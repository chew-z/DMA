#DMA
_Playing with Python, Numpy and 200 Daily Moving Average_
* * *
###ToDo
* importing market data to Matlab, then exporting and importing to Python is stupid. Write simple import procedure for csv.
* clean cut between 'rules.py' and 'formulas.py' modules. Formulas are immutable, rules change and evolve as they are defining system logic.
* generate signals (entry, exit rules) using TA-Lib
* take abstraction to next level - test using sets of rules
* genetic searching for 'good rules'?
* monitor 'market regime'

#### Is DMA200 providing any useful signals?
_Nothing sophisticated, Just playing with Python and Numpy to improve my skills and replace Matlab enviroment with Python._
